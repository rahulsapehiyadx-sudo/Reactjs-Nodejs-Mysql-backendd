@@TASK : RESET pwd with otp verification

steps: backend
Node.js Backend Steps
1. Define a Reset Password Route:
Create a POST route, such as /reset-password, to receive the password reset request from the React application. 
2. Verify User and Old Password:
In your Node.js route handler, retrieve the user's email from the database using their credentials. 
Compare the user's provided old password with the stored, hashed password in the database. If they don't match, return an error. 
3. Generate a Reset Token (Optional but Recommended for Added Security):
Generate a cryptographically secure, one-time-use token (e.g., using uuid or crypto module). 
You can optionally associate this token with the user's session or store it in a temporary storage, like Redis, with an expiry time. 
4. Update User's Password:
Hash the new password using a strong hashing algorithm (like bcrypt). 
Update the user's password in your database to the new hashed password. 
5. Send a Success Response:
If the password update is successful, send a success response back to the frontend. 

React Frontend Steps
1. Create a Reset Form Component:
Build a React component with input fields for the user's current password and their new password, along with a submit button. 
This component will be displayed to users who are already logged in. 
2. Handle Form Submission:
When the user submits the form, capture their current password and the new password. 
Send a POST request to a backend API endpoint (e.g., /api/reset-password) containing the user's email (for authentication), current password, and the new password. 

Understanding the Reset Token 
Purpose: A reset token serves as a temporary cryptographic key that temporarily authorizes the modification of a password. It is a crucial security measure used to verify a user's identity before they are permitted to change their password.
What it is: The token is a unique, time-limited string generated by the server.
How it works: The token is usually combined with the user's session or ID, and it is used to confirm that the user is authorized to reset their password, preventing malicious password changes.
